# Spring Boot Exploration

This repository is my personal space to **explore Spring Boot** and get hands-on with how things work.  
Iâ€™m not aiming for a perfect production-ready project here â€” just experimenting, breaking things, fixing them,  
and understanding the building blocks behind backend development.  

---

##  What I'm Curious About
- How authentication and authorization works in Spring Boot (JWT, Security filters, etc.)
- How to connect Spring Boot with databases (JPA, Hibernate).
- How REST APIs are structured and tested.
- How to configure projects properly (using `application.properties`, `.env`, etc.).
- How dependency injection really helps in building scalable apps.

---

## ðŸ›  Current Experiments
- User signup and login flow with JWT.
- Password encryption with Spring Security.
- Playing with `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`.
- Basic CRUD operations with JPA.

---

##  Why This Repo?
I wanted a **scratchpad** where I can try out things,  
document mistakes, and build a stronger foundation in Spring Boot.

---

##  Next on My List
- Role-based authentication.
- Refresh tokens.
- Connecting with MySQL/Postgres.
- Deploying a small Spring Boot app to the cloud.

---

##  Note
This is **not** a polished project â€” it's just me being curious and learning step by step.
